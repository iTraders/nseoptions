The python library is designed to fetch the Option Chain data available in the [NSE India](https://www.nseindia.com/option-chain)
website. Please refer to the Terms and Conditions and Usages Policies of NSE India.

## Getting Started

[NSE India Option Chain](https://www.nseindia.com/option-chain) is a free to use data that tracks prices for the expiry of any
boarder index (like `NIFTY`, `BANKNIFTY`, etc.) and also option chain information of any stock available for trading in the
exchanges (NSE/BSE). The module uses the NSE India API that returns the data as a JSON object and transforms (cleaning, analysis)
the data to be represented as a table (dataframe) or dump the data into an MS Excel file.

```python
pip install nseoptions # yet to be published

import nseoptions
import datetime as dt

response, data, metrics = nseoptions.core.NSEOptionChain(symbol = "NIFTY", expiry = dt.date(2027, 2, 27))
data.sample(3)
```

We recommend that you store the JSON response as is in a MongoDB like NoSQL database, and you can also store the parsed
dataframe into a simple SQL database.
